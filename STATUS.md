# Port status and handoff

This file is the single source of truth for where the project stands. Update it at every milestone.

## Goal
A native, open-source C++ port of Rule the Kingdom (Game Insight, 2012–2014). It has to match the original
game's code exactly, run on macOS (Apple Silicon) first and then any OS, and be developable going forward.
Offline-first: online-only features (PvP, friends, Facebook, purchases) are stubbed for now and may be
reworked to work offline later. Rebuilding the server is a separate future project.

## Source of truth
- Code: `../Android files/rule-the-kingdom-5-11-multi-android.apk`, `lib/armeabi-v7a/libkingdom.so`
  (Oct 2014, ARMv7). It has about 10.5k exported C++ symbols. The decompile lives in `out/decomp.c`
  (regenerate with the README).
- Assets, layered: 5.11 `assets/data` → `../files/main.27.kbf` → `../files/patch.33.kbf` → Win8 Appx
  `../WINDOWS/0EB8BD08.RuletheKingdom_5.0.0.39_x86__erk4rrwmt7jyt.Appx` (fallback).

## Accuracy rules (non-negotiable)
1. Every ported function carries a `// @0xADDR Class::Method` comment pointing at the original.
2. Formats and formulas come from the decompile or assembly, never from guessing at bytes.
3. When the decompile shows `extraout_sN`, read the assembly. The library is **softfp** (floats are passed
   in core registers), which the decompiler mishandles. Use `tools/ghidra_scripts/DumpAsm.java` +
   `tools/pic_strings.py`.
4. Anything not yet verified gets marked `// UNVERIFIED:` with the reason.

## Phase 1: formats (DONE)
| Format | Tool | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| res_desc/.jet, Win8 res_data, .kbf | `tools/rtk_extract.py` | every entry, in all 4 sources |
| maps (old + chunk format) | `tools/rtk_map.py` | all referenced maps byte-exact; 14 dead 2012 files are unused |
| .xmlb UI layouts | `tools/rtk_xmlb.py` | 304/304 internally consistent |
| static map render | `tools/render_map.py` | map_0 matches the reference screenshot |

## Phase 2: engine (IN PROGRESS)
Stack: C++17, CMake, SDL3, OpenGL (the game's own GLSL), pugixml, libpng/libjpeg, zlib, FreeType.

Milestones:
1. [ ] Native window showing map_0 live with pan/zoom, rendered by ported C++
       (FileManager → Resources → Render → Map::Load → Background/Decor/Building sprites).
2. [ ] GUI from .xmlb (HUD, windows, text).
3. [ ] Game data + GameState + save/load; building and economy loops.
4. [ ] Entities/AI/pathing, quests (Tasks), combat, campaign maps.

## Open questions (tracked)
- The terrain colour-mask texture (shader type 2, sampler `colorMask`) is not identified yet.
- Building+0xCC (input to GetSpriteZ for building parts) has an unknown source.
- `GameState::playerSeed` initialisation for new games (FUN_00193d44) hasn't been read.
- 47 UI images aren't in any source; most are online-only screens.

## Key facts (see the tools for details)
- Ghidra image base 0x10000: file vaddr = Ghidra address − 0x10000.
- Projection: worldX = x·84 + (y odd ? 42 : 0), worldY = y·21. A sprite position is its bottom-left corner.
- Layers: 0 ground + horizon, 1 dark grass, 2/3 flat decor + flag posts, 7 rings, 8 objects (sorted by Z
  with SpriteSortZ: higher z first), 11 overlays, 14 GUI.
